# Core Concepts

The essential points for understanding and effectively using MLChain can be
grouped into the following categories:

- [ML Deployment](#MlModelDeploy)
- [Model Sharing](#ModelSharing)
- [Workflow](#workflow)

This document serves as an introduction to each of these categories. When
you're ready to dive deeper, each category has its own section in our
documentation. These sections allows you to understand the inner working of particular functions, along with 
real life example using our service.

## ML Deployment
Simple Machine Learning model deployment is the central feature of ML Chain library.
Our ServeModel function allows user to deploy their model without requiring software engineering knowledge.
We support Flask and grpc for website hosting.

## Model Sharing
This use our client service that allows users to share their ML models to other users, along with reusing and coming 
back to them everytime they want to redeploy their model.

## Workflow
